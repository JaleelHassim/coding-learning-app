# For now, our models are implicitly handled by the in-memory dictionaries
# in __init__.py (users_db, rides_db) and how we structure that data.
# As the application grows, we would define classes here, especially
# if using an ORM like SQLAlchemy.

# Example of how a User class might look if we were using classes more formally
# for the in-memory store or with an ORM:

# class User:
#     def __init__(self, id, name, email, password_hash, user_type):
#         self.id = id
#         self.name = name
#         self.email = email
#         self.password_hash = password_hash
#         self.user_type = user_type # 'passenger' or 'driver'

#     def __repr__(self):
#         return f"<User {self.email}>"

# class Ride:
#     def __init__(self, id, passenger_id, pickup_location, dropoff_location, status="pending", driver_id=None, fare=None):
#         self.id = id
#         self.passenger_id = passenger_id
#         self.driver_id = driver_id
#         self.pickup_location = pickup_location
#         self.dropoff_location = dropoff_location
#         self.status = status # e.g., 'pending', 'accepted', 'started', 'completed', 'cancelled'
#         self.fare = fare

#     def __repr__(self):
#         return f"<Ride {self.id} - {self.status}>"

# We will define the structure of user and ride objects directly when we interact
# with users_db and rides_db in routes.py and auth.py for now.
